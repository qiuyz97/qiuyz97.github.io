<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm now a third-year joint Ph.D. student from [School of Engineering Science](https://ses.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) (‰∏≠ÂõΩÁßëÂ§ßÂ∑•Á®ãÁßëÂ≠¶Â≠¶Èô¢), and [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/bme/), [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) (È¶ôÊ∏ØÂüéÂ∏ÇÂ§ßÂ≠¶ÁîüÁâ©ÂåªÂ≠¶Â∑•Á®ãÁ≥ª). My major at USTC is Instrument Science and Technology (code: 0804). 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Erbao Dong (Ëë£‰∫åÂÆù)](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/dongerbao/en/index.htm) of BIR Lab and [Prof. Xinge Yu (‰∫éÊ¨£Ê†º)](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/xingeyu.htm) of [Lab of Soft Bio-electronics](https://yu-electronics.com/). 

My research interests include **Robotics** (for example, Soft Robotics), **Tactile Sensors** (especially Vision-based tactile sensors), and **Flexible Electronics**. 

Throughout my ten years of academic journey, the word ‚Äúrobotics‚Äù has always been a central theme. To better understand and explore the Robotics field, To better understand and explore the field of robotics, I participated in several competitions and engineering programs related to robotics and vision technologies during my undergraduate and master‚Äôs studies, achieving notable results in each. 

During my Ph.D., I gained a deeper understanding of the critical role that visual and tactile perception play in enabling robots to autonomously explore their environments. As a result, my doctoral research focused on developing high-performance tactile perception methods for robotic applications. In 2022, I was fortunate to join a joint Ph.D. program between University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) and City University of Hong Kong. Under the supervision of Prof. Xinge Yu, I acquired extensive knowledge in the field of flexible electronics and participated in several related projects. This valuable experience not only broadened my perspective and expertise in physiological signal perception and feedback technologies but also inspired me to apply flexible electronics in robotics. Looking ahead, I plan to continue my research and exploration in Robotics, Tactile Sensors, and Flexible Electronics. 

To date, I have published 7 papers <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O1vIXuEAAAAJ"> with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O1vIXuEAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>33</span></strong></a> in the SCI journals.
